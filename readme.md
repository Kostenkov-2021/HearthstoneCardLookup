# Hearthstone Card Lookup

This is an NVDA addon that lets users quickly lookup info for a specific Hearthstone card by its name.

## Usage

Either select the text of a card name or have it copied to your clipboard, then press NVDA + H, which will try to find the card info and display it in a pop-up browseable window.

### Example output

8 mana
6 6
Divine Shield. Taunt. Deathrattle: Equip a 5/3 Ashbringer.

If you haven't heard the Tirion Fordring theme song, it's because it doesn't exist.
